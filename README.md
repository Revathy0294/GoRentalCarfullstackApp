# GoRentalCarfullstackApp

I developed Go Rental Car application using react, express , node.js, mongo db. I opted this becuase, it supports fll stack javascript development, rich ecosystem, we have to use single language throughout entire stack eliminates the need to learn and switch between multiple programming languages. if customer want to enlarge his business then mern technnology supports the requirement.I opted mongo db because it is a NoSQL document database that provides flexibility and scalability. MERN stack in terms of developer productivity, community support, code reuse, and the ability to build modern, scalable, and interactive web applications.
